    <h1>It is startling to think that, even in the darkest depths of World War II, J. R. R. Tolkien was
        writing the trilogy, which contains, with the weird applicability available only to poetry and
        myth, the essential notion that the good gray wizard can understand the evil magi precisely
        because he is just enough like them to grasp their minds and motives in ways that they cannot
        grasp his.
